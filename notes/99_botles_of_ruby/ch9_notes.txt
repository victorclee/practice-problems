Unit tests are meant to test the public API of a single class

A general approach to testing should be to create a unit test for every class, and to test every method in the class's public API

Faux unit tests that reach out to cover distant collaborators become increasingly unhelpful to hte next programmer. The code could break quite far from the origin of the problem.
When something goes wrong, it's the unite tests that provide an error message near the offending line of code. They narrow the set of potential code culprits.
